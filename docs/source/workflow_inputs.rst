Workflow Inputs
===============

Introduction
------------

OpenStudio-ERI requires a building description in an `HPXML file <https://hpxml.nrel.gov/>`_ format.
HPXML is an open data standard for collecting and transferring home energy data.
Using HPXML files reduces the complexity and effort for software developers to leverage the EnergyPlus simulation engine.

HPXML Inputs
------------

HPXML is an flexible and extensible format, where nearly all elements in the schema are optional and custom elements can be included.
Because of this, a stricter set of requirements for the HPXML file have been developed for purposes of running an Energy Rating Index calculation.

HPXML files submitted to OpenStudio-ERI should undergo a two step validation process:

1. Validation against the HPXML Schema

  The HPXML XSD Schema can be found at ``hpxml-measures/HPXMLtoOpenStudio/resources/HPXML.xsd``.
  It should be used by the software developer to validate their HPXML file prior to running the workflow.
  XSD Schemas are used to validate what elements/attributes/enumerations are available, data types for elements/attributes, the number/order of children elements, etc.

  OpenStudio-ERI **does not** validate the HPXML file against the XSD Schema and assumes the file submitted is valid.
  However, OpenStudio-ERI does automatically check for valid data types (e.g., integer vs string), enumeration choices, and numeric values within min/max.

2. Validation using `Schematron <http://schematron.com/>`_

  The Schematron document for the ERI use case can be found at ``rulesets/301EnergyRatingIndexRuleset/resources/301validator.xml``.
  Schematron is a rule-based validation language, expressed in XML using XPath expressions, for validating the presence or absence of inputs in XML files. 
  As opposed to an XSD Schema, a Schematron document validates constraints and requirements based on conditionals and other logical statements.
  For example, if an element is specified with a particular value, the applicable enumerations of another element may change.
  
  OpenStudio-ERI **automatically validates** the HPXML file against the Schematron document and reports any validation errors, but software developers may find it beneficial to also integrate Schematron validation into their software.

.. important::

  Usage of both validation approaches (XSD and Schematron) is recommended for developers actively working on creating HPXML files for Energy Rating Index calculations:

  - Validation against XSD for general correctness and usage of HPXML
  - Validation against Schematron for understanding XML document requirements specific to running ERI calculations

HPXML Enclosure
---------------

The dwelling unit's enclosure is entered in ``/HPXML/Building/BuildingDetails/Enclosure``.

All surfaces that bound different space types of the dwelling unit (i.e., not just thermal boundary surfaces) must be specified in the HPXML file.
For example, an attached garage would generally be defined by walls adjacent to conditioned space, walls adjacent to outdoors, a slab, and a roof or ceiling.
For software tools that do not collect sufficient inputs for every required surface, the software developers will need to make assumptions about these surfaces or collect additional input.

Interior partition surfaces (e.g., walls between rooms inside conditioned space, or the floor between two conditioned stories) can be excluded.

For single-family attached (SFA) or multifamily (MF) buildings, surfaces between unconditioned space and the neighboring unit's same unconditioned space should set ``InteriorAdjacentTo`` and ``ExteriorAdjacentTo`` to the same value.
For example, a foundation wall between the unit's vented crawlspace and the neighboring unit's vented crawlspace would use ``InteriorAdjacentTo="crawlspace - vented"`` and ``ExteriorAdjacentTo="crawlspace - vented"``.

.. warning::

  It is the software tool's responsibility to provide the appropriate building surfaces. 
  While some error-checking is in place, it is not possible to know whether some surfaces are incorrectly missing.

Also note that wall and roof surfaces do not require an azimuth to be specified. 
Rather, only the windows/skylights themselves require an azimuth. 
Thus, software tools can choose to use a single wall (or roof) surface to represent multiple wall (or roof) surfaces for the entire building if all their other properties (construction type, interior/exterior adjacency, etc.) are identical.

To define an air distribution system, additional information is entered in ``HVACDistribution/DistributionSystemType/AirDistribution``.

  .. [#] AirDistributionType choices are "regular velocity", "gravity", or "fan coil" and are further restricted based on attached HVAC system type (e.g., only "regular velocity" or "gravity" for a furnace, only "fan coil" for a shared boiler, etc.).
  .. [#] NumberofReturnRegisters required only if ``AirDistribution/Ducts`` are present.

For the air distribution system, duct leakage inputs are required if AirDistributionType is "regular velocity" or "gravity" and optional if AirDistributionType is "fan coil".

When provided, duct leakage must be entered in one of three ways:

1. **Leakage to the Outside**

  Supply and return leakage to the outside are each entered as a ``HVACDistribution/DistributionSystemType/AirDistribution/DuctLeakageMeasurement``:
  
  ================================  =======  =======  ===========  ========  =========  =========================================================
  Element                           Type     Units    Constraints  Required  Default    Notes

2. **Total Leakage** (Version 2014ADEGL or newer)

  ================================  =======  =======  ===========  ========  =========  =========================================================
  
  If the ResidentialFacilityType is "apartment unit", OS-ERI will calculate leakage to outside for the given distribution system as half the total leakage.
  
  If the ResidentialFacilityType is anything else, OS-ERI will calculate leakage to outside for the given distribution system based on total leakage, the fraction of duct surface area outside conditioned space, and HVAC capacities.
  OS-ERI currently assumes the air handler is located outside conditioned space; future inputs will be available to describe when the air handler is within conditioned space.
  
  .. warning::

    Total leakage should only be used if the conditions specified in ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301 have been appropriately met.
    OS-ERI does not check that, for example, the total duct leakage or infiltration requirements for dwellings and townhouses have been met per ANSI 301; that is currently the responsibility of the software developer.

3. **Leakage to Outside Testing Exemption** (Version 2014AD or newer)

   A duct leakage to outside testing exemption is entered in ``HVACDistribution/DistributionSystemType/AirDistribution``:

  OS-ERI will use a DSE of 0.88 for the given distribution system.

  .. warning::

    The duct leakage to outside testing exemption should only be used if the conditions specified in ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301 have been appropriately met.

  .. [#] Location only choice is "living space".
  .. [#] The sum of all ``FractionDehumidificationLoadServed`` (across all Dehumidifiers) must be less than or equal to 1.

.. note::

  Dehumidifiers only affect ERI scores if Version 2019AB or newer is used, as dehumidifiers were incorporated into the ERI calculation as of 301-2019 Addendum B.

.. note::

  Dehumidifiers are currently modeled as located within conditioned space; the model is not suited for a dehumidifier in, e.g., a wet unconditioned basement or crawlspace.
  Therefore the dehumidifier Location is currently restricted to "living space".

Validating & Debugging Errors
-----------------------------

When running HPXML files, errors may occur because:

#. An HPXML file provided is invalid (either relative to the HPXML schema or the ERI Use Case).
#. An unexpected error occurred in the workflow (e.g., applying the ERI 301 ruleset).
#. An unexpected EnergyPlus simulation error occurred.

If, for example, the Rated Home is unsuccessful, first look in the ERIRatedHome/run.log for details.
If there are no errors in that log file, then the error may be in the EnergyPlus simulation -- see ERIRatedHome/eplusout.err.

Contact us if you can't figure out the cause of an error.

Sample Files
------------

Dozens of sample HPXML files are included in the workflow/sample_files directory.
The sample files help to illustrate how different building components are described in HPXML.

Each sample file generally makes one isolated change relative to the base HPXML (base.xml) building.
For example, the base-dhw-dwhr.xml file adds a ``DrainWaterHeatRecovery`` element to the building.

You may find it useful to search through the files for certain HPXML elements or compare (diff) a sample file to the base.xml file.
