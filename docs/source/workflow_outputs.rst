Workflow Outputs
================

Upon completing an OpenStudio-ERI run, a variety of summary output files and simulation files are available:

- :ref:`summary_outputs_csv`
- :ref:`home_annual_outputs_csv`
- :ref:`home_timeseries_outputs_csv`
- :ref:`home_configurations_hpxml`
- :ref:`home_energyplus_files`
- :ref:`hers_diagnostic_output`

All CSV output files can be alternatively requested in JSON format; see :ref:`running`.

.. note::

  MBtu is defined as one million Btu.

Annual Energy By End Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

End uses are listed below.

Note that all end uses are mutually exclusive -- the "Electricity: Heating" end use, for example, excludes energy reported in the "Electricity: Heating Fans/Pumps" end use.
So the sum of all end uses for a given fuel (e.g., sum of all "End Use: Natural Gas: \*") equal the above reported fuel use (e.g., "Fuel Use: Natural Gas: Total").

When requested, a CSV file of timeseries outputs is written for the Reference/Rated Homes (e.g., ``ERIReferenceHome_Hourly.csv``, ``ERIReferenceHome_Daily.csv``, or ``ERIReferenceHome_Monthly.csv`` for the Reference home).

Depending on the outputs requested, CSV files may include:

  .. [#] This is the argument provided to ``energy_rating_index.rb`` as described in the :ref:`running` usage instructions.

Timeseries outputs can be one of the following frequencies: hourly, daily, or monthly.

Timestamps in the output use the start-of-period convention.
Most outputs will be summed over the hour (e.g., energy) but some will be averaged over the hour (e.g., temperatures, airflows).

.. _home_configurations_hpxml:

Home Configurations (HPXML)
---------------------------

Based on which calculations were requested in the HPXML file, home configuration details in HPXML format will be found in the ``results`` directory for each simulated home.
The HPXML files will have the same filename as the :ref:`home_annual_outputs_csv` output files, but with a .xml extension instead of .csv.
The files reflect the configuration of the home after applying, e.g., the ERI 301 ruleset.

The files will also show HPXML default values that are applied as part of modeling the home.
Defaults will be applied for a few different reasons:

#. Optional ERI inputs aren't provided (e.g., ventilation rate for a vented attic, SHR for an air conditioner, etc.)
#. Modeling assumptions (e.g., 1 hour timestep, Jan 1 - Dec 31 run period, appliance schedules, etc.)
#. HVAC sizing calculations (e.g., autosized HVAC capacities and airflow rates, heating/cooling design temperatures and loads)

Any defaulted values will include the ``dataSource='software'`` attribute in the HPXML file.

.. _home_energyplus_files:

Home EnergyPlus Files
---------------------

In addition, raw EnergyPlus simulation input/output files are available for each simulation (e.g., ``ERIRatedHome``, ``ERIReferenceHome``, etc. directories).

.. warning:: 

  It is highly discouraged for software tools to read the raw EnergyPlus output files. 
  The EnergyPlus input/output files are made available for inspection, but the outputs for certain situations can be misleading if one does not know how the model was created. 
  If there are additional outputs of interest that are not available in the annual/timeseries output files, please send us a request.

.. _hers_diagnostic_output:

HERS Diagnostic Output
----------------------

A HERS diagnostic output file (``HERS_Diagnostic.json``) can be produced if the ``--output-diagnostic`` commandline argument is used; see the :ref:`running` section.
The output file includes hourly data and is formatted per the `HERS Diagnostic Output Schema <https://github.com/resnet-us/hers-diagnostic-schema>`_.
