Accuracy vs Speed
-----------------

The EnergyPlus simulation engine is like a Swiss army knife.
There are often multiple models available for the same building technology with varying trade-offs between accuracy and speed.
This workflow standardizes the use of EnergyPlus (e.g., the choice of models appropriate for residential buildings) to provide a fast and easy to use solution.

The workflow is continuously being evaluated for ways to reduce runtime without significant impact on accuracy.
A number of such enhancements have been made to date.

There are additional ways that software developers using this workflow can reduce runtime:

- Run on Linux/Mac platform, which is significantly faster by taking advantage of the POSIX fork call.
- Use the ``--no-ssl`` flag to prevent SSL initialization in OpenStudio.
- Do not use the ``--hourly-output`` flag unless hourly output is required.
- Run on computing environments with 1) fast CPUs, 2) sufficient memory, and 3) enough processors to allow all simulations to run in parallel.
