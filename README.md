The OpenStudio-ERI project allows calculating an Energy Rating Index (ERI) using the Department of Energy's open-source [OpenStudio](https://www.openstudio.net/)/[EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net/) simulation platform.
The building description is provided in an [HPXML file](https://hpxml.nrel.gov/) format.

The project supports:
- ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301© Standard for the Calculation and Labeling of the Energy Performance of Dwelling and Sleeping Units using an Energy Rating Index
- ENERGY STAR Certification System for Homes and Apartments Using an Energy Rating Index-Based Compliance Path
