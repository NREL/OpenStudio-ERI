The OpenStudio-ERI project allows calculating an Energy Rating Index (ERI) using the Department of Energy's [EnergyPlus™](https://energyplus.net/) simulation platform.
The building description is provided in an [HPXML file](https://hpxml.nrel.gov/) format.
OpenStudio-ERI is intended to be used by user interfaces or other automated software workflows that automatically produce the HPXML file.

The project supports:
- ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301© Standard for the Calculation and Labeling of the Energy Performance of Dwelling and Sleeping Units using an Energy Rating Index
- ENERGY STAR Certification System for Homes and Apartments Using an ERI Compliance Path
- IECC ERI Compliance Alternative (Section R406)
- DOE ZERH Certification Using an ERI Compliance Path

For more information on running simulations, generating HPXML files, etc., please visit the [documentation](https://openstudio-eri.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

OpenStudio-ERI uses [OpenStudio-HPXML](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-HPXML) to run the individual EnergyPlus simulations.
