- Allows HRVs/ERVs to be specified with `AdjustedSensibleRecoveryEfficiency` and `AdjustedTotalRecoveryEfficiency` (instead of `SensibleRecoveryEfficiency` and `TotalRecoveryEfficiency`)
- Allows ducts to be located outside (`DuctLocation="outside"`)
- Allows water heaters to be located outside (`Location="other exterior"`)
- All simulation/HPXML/etc. files generated from running tests are now saved to the `workflow/tests/test_files` directory

- Fixes ERI Rated Home mechanical ventilation and infiltration when Rated Home has no mechanical ventilation
- Fixes missing heating system in HVAC2b.xml test file
