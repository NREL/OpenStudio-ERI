   ** Warning ** Timestep: Requested number (1) is less than the suggested minimum of 4.
   **   ~~~   ** Please see entry for Timestep in Input/Output Reference for discussion of considerations.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 2 zones are not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** Surfaces in Zone/Enclosure="UNVENTED ATTIC" do not define an enclosure.
   **   ~~~   ** Number of surfaces <= 3, view factors are set to force reciprocity but may not fulfill completeness.
   **   ~~~   ** Reciprocity means that radiant exchange between two surfaces will match and not lead to an energy loss.
   **   ~~~   ** Completeness means that all of the view factors between a surface and the other surfaces in a zone add up to unity.
   **   ~~~   ** So, when there are three or less surfaces in a zone, EnergyPlus will make sure there are no losses of energy but
   **   ~~~   ** it will not exchange the full amount of radiation with the rest of the zone as it would if there was a completed enclosure.

   ** Warning ** The Standard Ratings is calculated for Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed = CENTRAL AC CLG COIL but not at the AHRI test condition due to curve out of bound.
   **   ~~~   **  Review the Standard Ratings calculations in the Engineering Reference for this coil type. Also, use Output:Diagnostics, DisplayExtraWarnings for further guidance.
   ** Warning ** Check input. Pump nominal power or motor efficiency is set to 0, for pump=PUMP VARIABLE SPEED 1
